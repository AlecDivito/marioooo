# Mariooo

This is a college project that I did while at Sheridan college.
It was my end of term project and i wanted to build a platformer
similar to mario. I built this in 2018 and decided that i wanted
to rebuild it, but for my mac.

## Dependancies

This project depends on the following software being installed
on your computer:

1. cmake
2. make
3. sfml@2

You can install them all with brew.

```bash
brew install sfml
```

## Building

Turns out, with ChatGPT, thats not such a hard thing to do. If
you want to get this running locally (not sure why you'd want to)
you can follow these commands:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
mv final_mario ..
cd ..
./final_mario
```

## Gameplay

The game just uses your keyboard to control the character. There seem to be bugs
in the program...maybe i'll fix them...
